        *Spells.* While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC:giant insect(4 charges) orinsect plague(5 charges).
        *Insect Cloud.* While holding the staff, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause a swarm of harmless flying insects to spread out in a 30-foot radius from you. The insects remain for 10 minutes, making the area heavily obscured for creatures other than you. The swarm moves with you, remaining centered on you. A wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses the swarm and ends the Effect.
